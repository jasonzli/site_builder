## Learning + Play

Today we are going to play a game. Working in teams you will compete to complete the concept map of several key figures, institutions, ideas, and inventions related to **Learning + Play**. We are playing this game for several reasons:

### Part 0: Preparation

_Instructor, 20 minutes_

Draw out the **just the connections** of concept map on the board, leaving room for the items. Assign groups and concept cards.

### Part 1: Research

_Groups, 10 minutes_

Each group has a set of cards naming a concept that fits somewhere on the concept map.

1. Write your team's names on the **back** of your card.
2. Spend a few minutes researching each of the concepts on cards.
3. Create a summary describing each concept in **exactly 7 words**.
4. Clearly write your 7-word summary on the **front** of your card.

If you have time left over discuss how the items on your cards relate to each other and study the map. Guess where each card might belong.

### Part 2: Map

_Class, 40 minutes_

Groups take turns adding concept cards to the concept map. **The first group to get rid of all of their cards wins.**

1. Chose one of your team's concept cards.
2. Announce your chosen concept, and read your seven-word summary to the class.
3. Propose a location on the map.
4. If your location is correct, the card is added. If not, your group keeps card.
5. The next group takes a turn.

### Part 3: Elaborate

_Instructor, 10 minutes_

The instructor spends a few minutes explaining key ideas and concepts in more detail.

## Thoughts on the Map

### Why we Played this Game

- Introduce key philosophies, figures, institutions, and tools related to project-based learning and play.
- Emphasize the relationships between these concepts and connect them to students' day-to-day experience.
- Frame learning as an active, student-led process of constructing knowledge.
- Introduce concept maps as a way of organizing and understanding ideas and their relationships.
- Help students learn how to approach Comp Form for maximum benefit.

### Constructivism

learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge {bigger}

- Jean Piaget studied cognitive development and genetic epistemology.
- humans build new understanding in relation to their existing experiences, knowledge, and ideas
- suggests that education should be viewed as student-lead learning rather than instructor-led teaching

#### Weekly Exploration

This class is built as a series of one week explorations of related topics. I hope it makes the topics accessible to a variety of students by providing conceptual footholds. I also hope this approach frames procedural generation as a network of connected tools, techniques, and media.

### Constructionism

learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product{bigger}

- Seymour Papert studied with Jean Piaget and then founded the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at MIT
- Supports providing tools and environments for creative exploration as a means of promoting learning

#### Sketch Log

I built the sketch log website to shape the environment in which Comp Form is taught. Encouraging daily sketching and peer-to-peer learning and motivation.

#### Activities vs Lectures

I try to balance class time towards hands-on activities, discussions, code challenges and away from lectures. This requires faith in the effectiveness of constructionism to quiet the fear that something important won't be mentioned without a lecture.

### Creative Learning Spiral

imagine → create → play → share → reflect → imagine{bigger}

#### Daily Sketching

The homework structure is designed to directly support the kind of learning described by the creative learning spiral. Rather than fixed assignments students are given the opportunity to _imagine_ what they want to make. They are encouraged to _create_ that thing and _play_ with the ideas presented each week through a series of low-stakes sketches. The homework is meant to be done in small, spaced amounts allowing time to _share_ the work and _reflect_ on each piece in multiple cycles each week. Looking at both their own work and the work created by the rest of the class students are encouraged to _imagine_ new things to make.
