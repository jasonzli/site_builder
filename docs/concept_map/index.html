<p>Today we are going to play a game. Working in teams you will compete to complete the concept map of several key figures, institutions, ideas, and inventions related to <strong>Learning + Play</strong>. We are playing this game for several reasons:</p>
<h3 id="part-0-preparation">Part 0: Preparation</h3>
<p><em>Instructor, 20 minutes</em></p>
<p>Draw out the <strong>just the connections</strong> of concept map on the board, leaving room for the items. Assign groups and concept cards.</p>
<h3 id="part-1-research">Part 1: Research</h3>
<p><em>Groups, 10 minutes</em></p>
<p>Each group has a set of cards naming a concept that fits somewhere on the concept map.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write your team’s names on the <strong>back</strong> of your card.</li>
<li>Spend a few minutes researching each of the concepts on cards.</li>
<li>Create a summary describing each concept in <strong>exactly 7 words</strong>.</li>
<li>Clearly write your 7-word summary on the <strong>front</strong> of your card.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have time left over discuss how the items on your cards relate to each other and study the map. Guess where each card might belong.</p>
<h3 id="part-2-map">Part 2: Map</h3>
<p><em>Class, 40 minutes</em></p>
<p>Groups take turns adding concept cards to the concept map. <strong>The first group to get rid of all of their cards wins.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Chose one of your team’s concept cards.</li>
<li>Announce your chosen concept, and read your seven-word summary to the class.</li>
<li>Propose a location on the map.</li>
<li>If your location is correct, the card is added. If not, your group keeps card.</li>
<li>The next group takes a turn.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="part-3-elaborate">Part 3: Elaborate</h3>
<p><em>Instructor, 10 minutes</em></p>
<p>The instructor spends a few minutes explaining key ideas and concepts in more detail.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At an early age, Montessori broke gender barriers and expectations when she enrolled in classes at an all-boys technical school, with hopes of becoming an engineer. She soon had a change of heart and began medical school at the University of Rome, where she graduated – with honors – in 1896.</p>

<h2 id="thoughts-on-the-map">Thoughts on the Map</h2>
<h3 id="why-we-played-this-game">Why we Played this Game</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduce key philosophies, figures, institutions, and tools related to project-based learning and play.</li>
<li>Emphasize the relationships between these concepts and connect them to students’ day-to-day experience.</li>
<li>Frame learning as an active, student-led process of constructing knowledge.</li>
<li>Introduce concept maps as a way of organizing and understanding ideas and their relationships.</li>
<li>Help students learn how to approach Comp Form for maximum benefit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constructivism">Constructivism</h3>
<p class="bigger">learning as a reconstruction rather than as a transmission of knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li>Jean Piaget studied cognitive development and genetic epistemology.</li>
<li>humans build new understanding in relation to their existing experiences, knowledge, and ideas</li>
<li>suggests that education should be viewed as student-lead learning rather than instructor-led teaching</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="weekly-exploration">Weekly Exploration</h4>
<p>This class is built as a series of one week explorations of related topics. I hope it makes the topics accessible to a variety of students by providing conceptual footholds. I also hope this approach frames procedural generation as a network of connected tools, techniques, and media.</p>
<h3 id="constructionism">Constructionism</h3>
<p class="bigger">learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a meaningful product</p>
<ul>
<li>Seymour Papert studied with Jean Piaget and then founded the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at MIT</li>
<li>Supports providing tools and environments for creative exploration as a means of promoting learning</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sketch-log">Sketch Log</h4>
<p>I built the sketch log website to shape the environment in which Comp Form is taught. Encouraging daily sketching and peer-to-peer learning and motivation.</p>
<h4 id="activities-vs-lectures">Activities vs Lectures</h4>
<p>I try to balance class time towards hands-on activities, discussions, code challenges and away from lectures. This requires faith in the effectiveness of constructionism to quiet the fear that something important won’t be mentioned without a lecture.</p>
<h3 id="creative-learning-spiral">Creative Learning Spiral</h3>
<p class="bigger">imagine → create → play → share → reflect → imagine</p>
<h4 id="daily-sketching">Daily Sketching</h4>
<p>The homework structure is designed to directly support the kind of learning described by the creative learning spiral. Rather than fixed assignments students are given the opportunity to <em>imagine</em> what they want to make. They are encouraged to <em>create</em> that thing and <em>play</em> with the ideas presented each week through a series of low-stakes sketches. The homework is meant to be done in small, spaced amounts allowing time to <em>share</em> the work and <em>reflect</em> on each piece in multiple cycles each week. Looking at both their own work and the work created by the rest of the class students are encouraged to <em>imagine</em> new things to make.</p>
