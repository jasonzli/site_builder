is the p5 download bug fixed? should I jump in on that?

maybe split animation into two: prerender realtime

# Content




## Meta Data

## Template + Style


## References
- Find more, better, and more varied sources. 
- Too many Wikipedia links. Parameters has way to many, for example.
- Parameters might have too many side-bar references.
- Consider placement of references between sidebar and bottom.
- Should sidebar sources be repeated on bottom?
- Change "Reference Links" to "Suggested Reading"?

## Copy Style
- use bold (and italics) in the copy to improve variety and scanability

  - using Engage, Study, Activate for all?
  - Do i use "Activity:" and "Lecture:" and "Discussion:" consistently?
- Lesson plans take on additional content
  - team assignments
  - special assignments
  - class specific notes/dates
- make a T-15 minute entry for the song of the day, video of the day, etc.

## File Org
- x.organize
  - chapter
    - sketches
    - slides
    - figures
    index.md
    ...included yaml and md

## Front page
- x.Chapters
- x.Class Calender/Lesson Plans
- Links
  - x.Sketch Blog
  - x.Syllabus
  - Global Book/Resource/Site list? Maybe.
  - n.Class Notes Github? Nah.

## Page Priorities
- Pre-class Message
  - What to bring, be on time, what to watch ahead of time, etc.
  - Assignment 0: Watch
    - Every Frame a Painting (talk about understanding the media, and taking advantage of its unique qualities, maybe the one visual comedy hot fuzz director)
    - Mark Brown? Maybe spelunky one?
    - Two Minute Papers? which one though?

# Publishing System

## Template

## markdown_builder.js


## JSLab
- x.needs a hidden code mode (just run the sketch)
- .hidden code mode is just js-show, it doesn't do onScroll load unload, but that might be needed later

## Styles

## QA Concerns

- i took out trimlines on the ::: /:: blocks. any regressions?
- added debug=false to gulp-layout options to suppress pug console bart. any regressions?

# Research + Ideas

## Research to Include
- links from r/proceduralgeneration top alltime

# Chapter Idea: Number Bending
- talk about combining funcitons, talk about arrays as funcitons, talk about sequences from random as funcitons.
- e.g. a noisy random fuzz + a big square wav
- Look at scaling and offseting numbers, talk about map to do it
- Talk about lerp.
- Talk about pow(x, y) as a way to sharpen or blunt slopes


# Chapter Ideas
  - Color
  - Input Devices
  - Input APIs




## Resources To List
- [PCGBook: Chapter 1](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf)
- Mark Brown Videos
- 1 Minute Paper Videos
- Shifman art of code,
- Shifman other book?

Opening Question Review Sessions,

Mostly aesthetic currently, add some specific code discussion


in class "analog" excercises were very helpful (for aakanksha)

3*7*6 review worked well (the homework review where 6 groups wrote 3 findings in 7 words)

"Personally, I've had really bad experiences with groups" Aakanksha






## Get to Know p5

::: .links-sidebar
[p5: Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
/::

If you havenâ€™t used the following features of p5, take a look.


### colorMode()
Working with color in terms of hue, saturation, and brightness is often much better than RGB. Use `colorMode()`to switch to HSB colors, and to choose your ravinge (0-255, 0-100, 0-1).

### ellipseMode(), rectMode()
Sometimes the clearest way to draw a ellipse is to specify the bounding box corners. Sometimes the center and width/height makes more sense. Use these functions to switch how `ellipse()` and `rect()` use their arguments.

### push() + pop()
Normally if you change your drawing state (fill color, stroke weight, etc), it stays changed after you do your drawing. `push()` and `pop()` let you save and restore your state.

### lerp(), lerpColor()
These functions let you interpolate between two values.

### map()
Use `map()` to remap values from one range to another.
