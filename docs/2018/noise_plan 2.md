## Week 4, Noise {plain}

[Noise Chapter](./index.html) {boxed right}

### Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Describe what the `noise()` function does.
- Understand when, why, and how to use `noise()`
- Understand sampling, mapping, and controlling `noise()`
- Choose `noise()` vs. `random()`
- Describe the importance of Perlin Noise in procedural generation
- Qualities of Noise (Frequency, Amplitude, Smoothing, Layering, Dimensions)

### Materials

- 12-sided dice
- 1D Noise Worksheet: [Illustrator](../handouts/1d_noise_graph.ai), [SVG](../handouts/1d_noise_graph-01.svg)

### Outline

Homework Discussion

* reason for sketching

01 Noise

* `random()` completely, actually random
* `noise()` random, arranged variation with nice properties
* Perlin Noise is just one example, not the only one.
* Slides
* Many examples of noise focus on visualizing the noise. Leading students to think that the `noise()` function is mostly when you want something to look like `noise()`. On the contrary, the noise function can be used any time you want _good looking variation_. Also, you probably want to shape the noise a bit so it doesn't look like straight `noise()`.
* `random()` doesn't take parameters but `noise()` does. Understanding what parameters to pass in is often confusing when you start using `noise()`. Once you get a hang of it, the parameters become the key to the power of `noise()`.
* live code example using `noise()`

04 Noise Worksheet, Building Noise

* Dice, Decks, LUTs
* Roll Dice - Build an N-Dimensional infinite field
* Connect Dots - Create an interpolated look up
* Could extend to more dimensions (figures)
* compare `random()` (dice) to `noise()` (LUT)
* answer key question: where does input come from?
* Make a drawing like [ . o O . o o . O ] using dice, using noise
* Make an animation [ . -> O -> o ] using dice, using noise

02 Noise vs. Random + 03 Benefits of Noise

* `random()` is better when you want actually random _variation_
* `noise()` is better when you want aethetically pleasing _variation_
* Control Frequency
* Fractal Detail
* Control Repeatability
* Looks Good
* `random()` vs `noise()` examples
* 1D Noise Example
* Range of `noise()`
* Fractal Noise

Challenges

* Intro
* Coding
* Q+A

05 Working With Noise

* Calling Noise: What do you pass in?
* Controlling Frequency
* Amplitude and Range
* Detail (optional)
* Seed (optional)
