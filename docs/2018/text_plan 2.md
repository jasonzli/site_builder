| 1     | Xia, Patricia, Dahee <br/> Choose a work that you like, but are unsure how it was made. Describe what you see.                             |
| 2     | Bella, Leah, Carla <br/> Choose a sketch that follows this week's theme in a way that stands out from the others, an outlier.              |
| 3     | Aakanksha, Julian, Xu  <br/> Choose a work that you think looks good a full speed but probably rendered too slowly for real-time playback. |
| 4     | Alyssa, Ting, Jack <br/> Create a "tip" for making better sketches. Choose a sketch to illustrate.                                         |
| 5     | Madison, Earl, Patrick <br/> Choose your favorite bumper challenge. Discuss                                                                |
| 6     | Rik, Kirsten, Mario <br/> Choose a üòÇ, üòç, or ü§ì. Discuss.                                                                                 |
