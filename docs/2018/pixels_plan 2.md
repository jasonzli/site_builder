## Week 6, Pixel Data {plain}

[Pixel Data Chapter](./index.html){boxed right}

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Understand how raster image data is represented in memory.
- Describe the relationship between vector images, raster images, p5.js drawing api, and pixel access.
- Implement per-pixel image generation.
- Implement per-pixel image processing.
- Use an image as a data input.
- Use p5's `get()` and `set()` function to read and write pixel values.
- Use p5's `pixel[]` array to work with pixel data directly and faster.
