# Hello Students!

Welcome to Computational Form, I'm looking forward to meeting you all (and seeing some of you again).

# You have Homework

Please read this email fully and do everything listed here **before the first class** to be fully prepared.

# Bookmark this Site

The course website and textbook is http://compform.net

This site hosts the course calendar, syllabus, assignments, and lecture notes. Click the "Class Notes Fall 2020" link to access them.

Feel free to get started reading on any topics that you find interesting or look at the notes and work from previous semesters.

# Test Notion

We will be using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product) to keep shared notes during in-class activities.

Please visit [the class notion page](https://www.notion.so/Comp-Form-Class-Notion-ba10b7656379426695ca23c0fefdc7de) now to make sure you have access.

If access to notion is blocked for you, please try using the New School's Apps Anywhere service ([apps.newschool.edu](apps.newschool.edu)) to access the notion and email me to let me know that you were blocked, and if Apps Anywhere helps.

# Read the Syllabus

The Syllabus is on the class website. Read it now!

**Add three questions about the syllabus to the Class Notion > Week 1 > Syllabus Questions.**

These will count toward your "participation" grade! This can be an **easy A** or an **easy 0** to kick off your semester.

# Watch These Things

Watch these videos _before_ class on Wednesday:

[How (and Why) Spelunky Makes its Own Levels | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqk5Zf0tw3o)

<!-- [How Jonathan Blow Designs a Puzzle | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zK8ItePe3Y) -->

[Digital Creatures Learn to cooperate | Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmYKfU5O_NA)

# Read This Thing

Read this chapter _before_ class on Wednesday.

_Procedural Content Generation in Games_ is a free online textbook. The book focuses on gaming applications, but the [first chapter](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf) is good to read no matter what kind of procedural generation you are interested in. This is the only chapter of this book that will be assigned in Comp Form, but you might be interested in some of the other chapters, so take a look at the [table of contents](http://pcgbook.com/).

[First chapter of pcgbook](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf).

# Read This Thing Too

I usually start Computational Form by talking about tile based graphics. Its a fun topic, and works really well for a quick-start on-site workshop. I don't think it would work as well on-line, so I'm cutting it and we'll jump right into random numbers on the first day. It is still a fun topic though so take a little time to read the related chapter anyway.

Read the compform.net chapter on [tile maps](http://compform.net/tiles/).

# Buy These Things

This is optional, but recommended! Get a set of [polyhedral dice](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=polyhedral+dice&rh=p_85%3A2470955011&s=price-asc-rank&dc&qid=1598292783&rnid=2470954011&ref=sr_st_price-asc-rank). You can find single sets for ~$5 or buy several sets for ~$10.

If you can't get a physical set, there are [places](https://diceroll.fun/) you can roll online.

# Be on Time

The short version of my attendance policy:

**Attend every class, arrive early, stay late.**

I'll open the zooms early so everyone can join, make sure their AV is working, and get settled in.

# Be Prepared

Bring these things to Wednesday's class and to every class:

**computer + a Comp Form sketchbook + red pen + black pen + pencil + polyhedral dice + camera/phone**
