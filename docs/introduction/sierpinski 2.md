### Instructions


1. Draw an up-pointing equilateral triangle that fills most of the page.
2. Lightly mark the midpoint of each line of that triangle.
3. Draw straight lines connecting each of those marks.<br/>
   This forms **four** new triangles: **three** that point up, **one** that points down.
4. Choose any empty, up-pointing triangle on the page.
5. Go to instruction 2.


Yes, these instructions will go on forever. I'll interrupt you in a minute.
