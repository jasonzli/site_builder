## Physically Based Rendering

[Physically Based Rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) (PBR) is an approach to rendering graphics based on mathematically simulating how light reacts to surfaces. PBR simulates real-world surface properties including small bumps, roughness, and metallicity making it particularly well suited to photo-realistic styles.

![blender PBR](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/_images/render_cycles_nodes_types_shaders_principled_example-1a.jpg)

PBR shaders are common in both real-time game engines and pre-rendering engines and the workflow is relatively artist-friendly. Learning PBR texturing is very worthwhile.

From personal experience, spending 2 or 3 days learning the basics of PBR texturing with substance painter improved my 3D projects by at least 3x.

This [Substance Painter Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhBVsn2tfGc&t=949s) video is a pretty good introduction to what working in Substance Painter looks like. It is based on an older version, but the basics are still the same.

For a brief technical overview of PBR, try the [Allegortihmic PBR Guide](https://academy.allegorithmic.com/courses/the-pbr-guide-part-1)

## Substance Painter

PBR shaders rely on texture sets to describe the physical properties of a surface. In addition to a basic color texture, a PBR texture set has texture data for roughness, bumps, metallic, etc.

Substance Painter is a tool that makes working with PBR texture sets easy in multiple ways:

- Directly paint onto your 3D Object instead of the flat texture.
- Paint into all of the textures in the set simultaneously.
- Paint with materials that impact all the surface properties at once.
- Use "smart" materials and masks to automatically add realistic effects like ground dirt, dust, and scratches.
- Non-destructively switch between texture resolutions as needed for faster processing or higher quality display.
- Photoshop-like management of layers, folders, and composting.
- View the composite effect with a PBR shader in real-time in the viewport

## Challenge 1: Block

![Block](./block/wireframe.png)
Model of a beveled block created in Blender 2.8. [block.blend](./block/block.blend){figure}

Part 1:

1. Download the [block.fbx](./block/block.fbx) model.
2. Create a new Substance Painter project with the model.
3. Texture the block to look like a plastic six-sided die.
4. Texture the block to look like a clean concrete block.
5. Texture the block to look like a dirty concrete block.
6. What else can you turn the block into?



## Challenge 2: Amanita Muscaria

/::

1. Download the [amanita_muscaria.fbx](./amanita_muscaria/amanita_muscaria.fbx) model.
2. Create a new Substance Painter project with the model.
3. Study some [examples](https://www.google.com/search?q=amanita+muscaria) of Amanita Muscaria mushrooms online.
4. Use Substance Painter to **realisticly** texture the model.
5. Use Substance Painter to **stylisticly** texture the model.
