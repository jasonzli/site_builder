### Materials

3D Printers, Printed Examples

### Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

- Use OpenSCAD to create procedural 3D forms
- Create form using constructive solid geometry modeling
- Compare the functional and procedural programing paradigms
- Explore and discuss interesting OpenSCAD language features
- Explore using digital fabrication for procedurally generated content

### Quiz

1. Name as many programming paradigms as you can?
2. Which paradigms fit JavaScript?
3. Which paradigms fit OpenSCAD?
4. Javascript uses expression syntax with the operator between the operands like this: `2 + 4`. What is the name of that kind of notation?
5. What is the name of the other notation we talked about earlier?
6. What would multiplying 10 and 2 look like in prefix notation?
7. What is an example of prefix notation outside of code?
8. What does immutable mean?
