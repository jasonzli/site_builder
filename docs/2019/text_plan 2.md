| 1     | Batool, Alonso, Josefina  <br/> Choose a work that you like, but are unsure how it was made. Describe what you see.                       |
| 2     | Felix, Akshansh, Noah  <br/> Choose a sketch that follows this week's theme in a way that stands out from the others, an outlier.         |
| 3     | Kevin, Anna, Kathrin  <br/> Choose a work that you think looks good a full speed but probably rendered too slowly for real-time playback. |
| 4     | Tinsley, Andrew, Brad K.  <br/> Create a "tip" for making better sketches. Choose a sketch to illustrate.                                 |
| 5     | Brooke E., Ray, Janice  <br/> Choose your favorite bumper challenge. Discuss                                                              |
