## Week 6, Pixel Data {plain}

### Class Notes
[Pixels](../pixels){boxed right}

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how raster image data is represented in memory.
- Consider relationship between vector images, raster images, p5.js drawing api, and pixel access.
- Technical: Using p5's `get()` and `set()` function to read and write pixel values.
- Technical: Using p5's `pixel[]` array to work with pixel data directly and faster.
- Explore per-pixel image generation.
- Explore per-pixel image processing.
- Explore using an image as a data input.
