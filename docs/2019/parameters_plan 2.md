## Week 3, Parameters {plain}


### Class Notes
[Parameters](../parameters/index.html){boxed right}

### Learning Objectives
Students will be able to:
- Explore the relationship of parameters and interface design
- Practice problem analysis and interface design
- Practice user-centered design concepts
- Consider relationship between what you "make" and what you "design"
- Consider distinction between "choices" and "options"
- Reconsider parameters as desired outputs rather than specified inputs
- Technical: Exposing parameters as global variables
- Technical: Exposing parameters with HTML controls


### Materials
- Fictional Machines workshop decks `Machine Types`, `User Types`

## Homework Review


### Plan


What did you make this week?

*groups, 5 minutes*

In your assigned team, choose 1 or 2 sketches from the past week and use them to illustrate your answer to your team's question.

*class, 6x3 minutes*

Share your chosen sketch, comment on it and summarize your discussion.


### Groups

| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Batool, Archit, Janice  <br/>When allowing chance to influence their artwork, does an artist give up authorship?                                                             |
| 2     | Felix, Alonso,  Ivy<br/>Choose two sketches that you believe demonstrate a biasing technique discussed last week. What kind of bias do you think was used in each?           |
| 3     | Kevin, Akshansh,  Josefina<br/>Does computationally generated art have an inherent aesthetic?                                                                                |
| 4     | Tinsley, Anna ,  Noah<br/>Choose a work that combines procedural and non-procedural elements well. What works about this piece?                                              |
| 5     | Brooke, Andrew, Kathrin <br/>Choose a project that presents an interesting direction for further design inquiry. Suggest 5 possible avenues of development for this project. |
| 6     | Fei Bi, Ray, Jungu, Brad <br/>The challenge is not a competition. But who won?                                                                                               |
