### Attendance

I'm running attendance via a good-old-fashioned roll call. This will double as a tech-check to make sure everyone's mic and such are working.

### Video

If at all possible, keep your video camera on. Silly backrounds are encouraged. Keep it PG.

### Audio

Most classes are asking participants to mute their mics when not in use.

I'm asking you to keep you mics on unless there is backgound noise. I want people to be able to jump in with minimal friction. We'll change this if it doesn't work.

### Chat

Use the chat! Queue up some questions. This is one thing that works _better_ online.

## Homework Review

Using the sketches created by your classmates, compare the topics covered in class so far.

**Today's review is going to be different again today:**

- Get into groups.
- Review this week's sketches, and the sketches from previous weeks.
- Consider your group's prompt in terms of the overall work.
- Develop three specific "insights" related to your prompt to share with the class.
- Carefully phrase each insight in exactly 7 words.
- Add your insights here: [Class Notion](https://www.notion.so/Computational-Form-2020-24c18b32bb094547a76ea9daf3872475)
- Choose a sketch from any week to illustrate one of your insights. Add the sketch author and date on the notion.

**For example if your prompt was: "Inside vs Outside":**

- "Inside: darker in day, brighter at night."
- "Big things seem smaller when put outside."
- "People outside are going to other places."
