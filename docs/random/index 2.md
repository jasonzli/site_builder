## Random Values

We use the word *random* to mean an hodgepodge of related ideas. Depending on context we might mean unplanned, unexpected, unpatterned, uncontrolled, or unpredictable. Random values are a staple of procedural generation systems, often used as the main source of variety. 

Artists began working with randomness and chance long before the invention of computers. Then, as now, artists had to decide what aspects to control within a piece, and what aspects to leave to chance. 

The 18th-century composition *Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition*, [which may have been written](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikalisches_W%C3%BCrfelspiel) by Mozart, uses chance to select and sequence pre-composed musical phrases. By placing rules on selection and ordering of the phrases, the system ensures that each variation makes musical sense.


Consider the works below:

- Which aspects of each work were influenced by chance?
- Which aspects were controlled by the artist?

## The Methodical Application of Chance

Using random values in your procedural system doesn't mean your results must be haphazard, uncontrolled, or unorganized. While individual random values are unpredictable, you can use these values to create a coherent cumulative effect.

### Generating Random Numbers

Plain Javascript provides `Math.random()` to generate a random number.

::: .links-sidebar
[MDN<br/>`Math.random()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)
/::

> The Math.random() function returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number in the range [0, 1); that is, from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive), which you can then scale to your desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

MDN{attrib}



### Specifying a Range

`Math.random()` always gives you a value between 0 and 1. If you want a different range, you can scale and offset the value yourself:

```javascript
random() * range + start

// even distribution between [10 and 15)
random() * 5 + 10 
```

### Random Integers
The `Math.random()` function returns floating point values, but sometimes you want *integers*. The `Math.floor()` function will round a number down, chopping off the decimal part.

```javascript
// roll a standard die
Math.floor(Math.random()*6) + 1;
```

Be careful when generating integers: it is easy to get results that are slightly off. `Math.floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer, so you need to have values that go *above* the highest integer you want returned. 

Using `Math.round()` instead of `Math.floor()` can lead to unevenly distributed results. In the example below, `1` will get picked half as often as it should, and `7` will sometimes get picked though it should not.


::: .bad
```javascript
// roll a standard die
// this won't quite work. why?
Math.floor(Math.random()*7);

// this also doesn't quite work. why?
Math.round(Math.random()*6)+1;
```
/::

### p5 `random()`

Processing provides the `random()` function for generating random numbers. Without any parameters, `random()` works very much like `Math.random()` producing numbers between [0 and 1). 


```javascript
console.log("random()");        // random()
console.log(random());          // 0.45...
console.log(random());          // 0.12...
console.log(random());          // 0.37...
```

P5's `random()` function accepts optional parameters to control the range of the number, so you don't have to do it yourself. 

```
console.log("random(10)");      // random(10) -> range [0, 10)
console.log(random(10));        // 4.89...
console.log(random(10));        // 1.20...
console.log(random(10));        // 6.99...

console.log("random(20, 30)");  // random(20, 30) -> range [20, 30)
console.log(random(20, 30));    // 21.96...
console.log(random(20, 30));    // 20.56...
console.log(random(20, 30));    // 22.36...
```

P5 provides `floor()` which you can use to generate random integers.

```javascript
// roll a standard die
floor(random(0,6)) + 1
// or
floor(random(1,7))
```

::: .bad
```javascript
// this won't quite work. why?
floor(random(1,6))
```
/::




### Biased Distribution
The examples above will produce results evenly distributed across their range.

Often even distribution isn’t what you really want. Often you want to **bias** the results towards the low end, high end, or middle. Simple averaging and the `min()` and `max()` functions can help with this.

#### Even Distribution

```javascript
random(1,11)
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/even_bias.svg){scale}
/::


#### Low Bias Distribution

Taking the lowest of two or more random numbers will bias the result toward the low end.

```javascript
min(random(10), random(10))
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/low_bias.svg){scale}
/::

The more random numbers you use, the stronger the bias.

```javascript
min(random(10), random(10), random(10), random(10))
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/low_bias2.svg){scale}
/::


#### High Bias Distribution

Taking the highest of two or more random numbers will bias the result toward the high end.

```javascript
max(random(10), random(10))
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/high_bias.svg){scale}
/::


#### Middle Bias Distribution

Averaging two or more random numbers will bias the result toward the middle.

```javascript
(random(1,11) + random(1,11)) / 2
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/middle_bias.svg){scale}
/::


#### Normal Distribution

::: .links-sidebar
[Wikipedia:<br/> Normal Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
/::

If you generate several random numbers and average them, the results get close to **normal distribution**. Normal distribution, or Gaussian distribution, is the "bell curve" distribution which is often found in natural systems.

```javascript
(random(1,11) + random(1,11) + random(1,11)) / 3
```
{bigger}

::: .callout
![even distribution](./figures/normal_bias.svg){scale}
/::



::: .links-sidebar
[P5:<br/> `randomGaussian()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/randomGaussian)
/::

::: .callout
**Note:** P5 also provides the `randomGaussian()` function for generating numbers with a true normal distribution. With `randomGaussian()` the possible values are not clamped to a range; extreme outliers are just really rare.

### Dice vs. Decks

When you roll a **die**, you get **random values**. You **might get the same value more than once**, and it **might take a long time to get a particular value**.

If you roll a normal die six times, it is unlikely—*about a 1.5% chance*—that you’ll get all six values without repeats. You have a pretty good chance—*about 33%*–of not rolling any 1s. You can be pretty sure—*98.5% sure*—that at least one number won’t have appeared after six rolls. 

A **deck of cards** works differently. When you pull cards from a deck, you don't get random values. You get **values in a random order**. You avoid duplicates, and you know you will have toured all the values when you reach the end of the deck.

### Modeling a Deck with an Array


::: .links-sidebar
[P5:<br/> `shuffle()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/shuffle)
/::

p5 provides the `shuffle()` function to randomly reorder an array. Using shuffle we can simulate shuffling a deck, pulling values from it, and reshuffling when we run out.

```javascript
// create an array to hold the possible values
var values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

// create a variable to hold the current position in the deck
var position = 0;

function setup() {
    // shuffle the deck first
    values = shuffle(values);

    // pull as many values as we need
    for(let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        console.log(valueFromDeck());
    }
}

function valueFromDeck() {
    // find the value at the current position in the deck
    var v = values[position];

    // change the position for next time
    position++;

    // if we run out of "cards", shuffle and start over from the top
    if (position == values.length) {
        values = shuffle(values);
        position = 0;
    }

    // return the value
    return v;
}
```



### Random Choices

If you want your code to make a decision at random, you can combine `random()` with a conditional—`if`—statement.

```javascript
// do something only half the time
if (random() < .5) {
    console.log("Optional Thing");
}

// do something only 10% of the time
if (random() < .1) {
    console.log("Rare Thing");
}

// another way to do something only 10% of the time
if (random(100) < 10) {
    console.log("Rare Thing");
}
```

With `else` you can pick between two optional things to do.

```javascript
// do one thing, or the other. even odds.
if (random() < .5) {
    console.log("Option A");
} else {
    console.log("Option B");
}
```

With `else if` you can pick between multiple optional things to do.

```javascript
var r = random(100);

if (r < 20) {
    // r is < 20
    console.log("Rare Thing 1 (20%)");
} else if (r < 40){
    // r is >= 20 and < 40
    console.log("Rare Thing 2 (20%)"); 
} else {
    // r is >= 40
    console.log("Normal Thing (60%)");
}
```

A common mistake when following this pattern is calling random multiple times. If you are making one choice between several options, you only want to call `random()` once.

**Remember: 1 choice, 1 `random()`**

::: .bad

```javascript
// this code doesn't work as expected
if (random(100) < 20) {
    // Actually a 20% chance
    console.log("Rare Thing 1 (20%)"); 
} else if (random(100) < 40){
    // Actually a 32% chance
    console.log("Rare Thing 2 (20%)");
} else {
    // Actually a 48% chance
    console.log("Normal Thing (60%)"); 
}
```

## Pseudo-random vs. Random

Computers are deterministic systems. When a computer is in a particular state and performs a specific instruction, the resulting state will always be the same. **The results are never random.**

So how can `random()` produce a random value? Technically, it can't. It can produce values that *appear to be random*, called **pseudorandom values**. Pseudorandom values appear random—unless you look very closely—but are created by a deterministic process.

A common method to create pseudorandom values is a [Linear Congruential Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator).

LCGs begin with an initial value called the **seed**, then use multiplication, addition, and modulus (remainder after division) to derive a new, seemingly random value. Below is a very basic implementation of an LCG so you can see how they work.

::: js-lab
/random/sketches/random_lcg.js
/::

For our purposes, it is not important to understand exactly how the generator works. 

**It is important to understand that the sequence of `random()` numbers is perfectly predictable, if you know the seed.**

### Setting the Random Seed

::: .links-sidebar
[P5:<br/> `randomSeed()`](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/randomSeed)
/::


P5 provides `randomSeed()` to set the **seed** used by `random()`. Once you have set the seed, the sequence of values produced by random will always be the same.

::: js-lab
/random/sketches/seed.js
/::

By setting a seed you can use random values in your code, but get the same results each time you run your program. This can be a useful feature in many programs and can help with debugging problems.

Be careful when relying on the seed to get random but repeatable results. There are at least two common ways for things to get messed up.

- First, if your program accepts user input, and that input can influence how many times `random()` is called, your program can get off sequence.

- Second, if you change your program and add or remove a call to `random()`, you will alter the sequence.

::: .callout
Javascript does not provide any way for you to set the seed used by `Math.random()`, so if you need to set the seed and are not using p5, you'll need to find and use another Javascript library for generating random numbers.
