# Hello Students!

Welcome to Computational Form, I'm looking forward to meeting you all (and seeing some of you again). 


# You have Homework

Well, not much homework. Please read this email fully and do everything listed here **before the first class** to be fully prepared.


# Bookmark this Site
The course website and textbook is http://compform.net

This site hosts the course calendar, syllabus, assignments, and lecture notes. Click the "Class Notes 2020" link to access them.


# Read the Syllabus
The Syllabus is on the class website. Read it now!

**Bring three questions about the syllabus, typed on paper, to the first class.**

These will count toward your "participation" grade! This can be an **easy A** or an **easy 0** to kick off your semester.


# Watch These Things
Watch these videos *before* class on Wednesday:

[How (and Why) Spelunky Makes its Own Levels | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqk5Zf0tw3o)

<!-- [How Jonathan Blow Designs a Puzzle | Game Maker's Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zK8ItePe3Y) -->

[Digital Creatures Learn to cooperate | Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmYKfU5O_NA)


# Read This Thing

Read this chapter *before* class on Wednesday.

*Procedural Content Generation in Games* is a free online textbook. The book focuses on gaming applications, but the [first chapter](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf) is good to read no matter what kind of procedural generation you are interested in. This is the only chapter of this book that will be assigned in Comp Form, but you might be interested in some of the other chapters, so take a look at the [table of contents](http://pcgbook.com/).

[First chapter of pcgbook](http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter01.pdf).

# Be on Time
The short version of my attendance policy:

**Attend every class, arrive early, stay late.**


# Be Prepared
Bring these things to Wednesday's class and to every class:

**laptop + a Comp Form sketchbook + red pen + black pen + pencil + camera/phone**
