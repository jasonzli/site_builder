# Experimenting With Shaders

<div class="row">
<div class="col-6 col-md-6 overview top">
Experimenting with Shaders is an elective course in the MFA DT program at Parsons. In this course students will explore the potential of graphics programming with shaders, specialized programs that run on GPUs. This course will cover the basics of shader programming, GPU graphics pipelines, common shader environments and applications, and mathematics common in shader programming. 
</div>

<div class="col-6 col-md-6 overview top">
This class will utilize an experimental format. The first half of the course will include a Saturday crash-course followed by a standard course structure with faculty-led lectures and activities and weekly homework assignments. In the second half, students will work on an independently proposed long-term project and will design and lead hands-on class activities related to their projects.
